## Point 1:

Cryptocurrency has had almost 15 years to find its “killer app” and yet the most common use cases today are “Decentralized Finance” apps which most often focus on making money, and trading within the ecosystem itself, and NFTs which I would argue are a solution in search of a problem. The thing is the blockchain just is not the right medium for most apps. As crypto enthusiasts are rapidly re-learning there is a value in centralization, moderation, and in some cases mutability. But in it’s attempt to fix those pitfalls crypto has instead come full circle, reinventing the wheel it was supposed to replace in the first place. Turns out moderation is useful on opensea for removing stolen work or hate speech, to be able to fix bugs in smart contracts common practice is to use a proxy contract which forwards calls to another contract which can be switched out, we can’t access external data so we just use an “oracle” to give us the correct outside information, we can have subnets with permissioned blockchains where it can be limited to a certain group of validators thus preventing people other than the creator from validating it. It feels like we took two decades worth of experience in software development and security and reinvented it but worse (you’re telling me one of the most popular ways to store and manage and transact my money is a browser extension?!).

## Point 3:

Almost every time I open twitter I see a new instance of staggering amount of money being stolen or conned from the unsuspecting masses. It feels irresponsible to market NFTs and cryptocurrency to the masses (I think I counted superbowl ads from three different companies?) while having not addressed the fundamental security problems and potential for abuse. It is not the early days any more, you can not argue that it is only early adopters who know the risks. I have seen ads for Coinbase, crypto.com, and Gemini plastered across television and public places. I’ve seen Solana and Avalanche ads in the New York City subway station, the Avalanche ones sporting the catch phrase “It’s never to late to be early”. It is, if not immoral, extremely iresponsible to market crypto as something ready for the mainstream, while falling back on it being “the early” days when unsuspecting new crypto users get scammed out of sometimes millions of dollars.

## Point 4:

From the beginning crypto proponents have espoused a very egalitarian and libertarian world view. I agree with many of the things they say in principle: equal access, democratizing information, and the fundamental idea that **information should be free** (as in beer/freedom). Unfortunately I think that the crypto landscape has not only failed to solve those problems, but in many cases, made them even more worse.

The crypto landscape has fundamentally diverged from its stated goals. With the advent and popularization of NFTs and “Defi” applications it presents a rather bleak worldview where absolutely everything should and will be owned and commoditized. In trying to break out of the traditional economic systems they seem to have instead invented capitalisms final and worst stage.

I grew up on the corners of the internet Aaron Schwartz left behind. I was raised by artists and sorrounded with the amazing works they created. Everytime I look at the modern crypto landscape it makes me shiver. It feels like it’s maybe trying to kill pure art and expression, and replace it with the version of capitialism its critics always warned of.

This argument is the hardest to articulate and I went back and forth on whether or not to include it. It feels to easy for crypto evangalists to just tell me I don’t understand what it’s really about. But I don’t think it’s a matter of understanding more than it is a matter of priorities. The supposed selling point of NFTs is all about proving unqiueness and ownership. I just disagree on whether that is a good thing.

## Point 5:

Part of the reason I took such careful consideration on whether I should include the last section is because I think the way the crypto community interacts with anything, especially criticism, is fundamentally broken. If you spend any time in any crypto space (twitter, discord, reddit, etc) you will notice the term FUD, Fear Uncertainty and Doubt, used as a common response to critisim. The idea is basically that most criticism is design to sew FUD amongst the believers and as such should be disregarded.

FUD is an extension of a broader worldview found inside the crypto world: they are the ingroup, the disruptors, the people on the outside who critizize are trying to _**bring us down**_. The reasons given for why the outgroup is trying to ruin things are varied, sometimes it’s because they are jealous of the success of the ingroup, or they are protecting the establishment, or other things along those lines. It is not hard to see how one can jump from this constantly vigilant state, to the idea that most critisism is FUD spread by those on the outside who are out to ruin things for us. It is my personal belief that generally people have good intentions, and even though some don’t I should not let that fear guide me towards an undue negative disposition towards all others. I have found critism, even that which I vehemently disagree with, is usually proffered in good faith born of geniune ideas and opinion without ulterior motives. Are there exceptions to this rule? Of course, humans, as a general rule, are kinda known to suck sometimes. But even given that, I can’t treat all critisism as hostile, and in the occasional case where someone truly is not acting in good faith I do my best to respond as I always do—I can listen, respond the best I can, and move on. It brings to mind the quote from Jane West in her 1812 novel The Loyalists: An Historical Novel: “Let us not attribute to malice and cruelty what may be referred to less criminal motives”.

When discussing these critiscisms with members of the crypto community many of them have been dismissed as FUD. The thing is I really truly have no motive or desire to destroy or harm crypto, I just disagree with a lot of the current landscape.
