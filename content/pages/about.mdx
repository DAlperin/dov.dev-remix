    ## Curious student, professional software and web developer, entrepreneur, activist
    and fast learner. Passionate about the places hardware and software combine,
    space exploration, using technology to make a difference, and “making” in almost
    any form (ask me about my quest to perfect the perfect Buffalo wing sauce). I
    seek interesting problems & love that feeling I get when something I made starts
    working the way it’s intended to.
